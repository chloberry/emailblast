Dear ${PERSONNAME},

My name is Chloe Chan, and I am a business student and sports enthusiast from Queen's University, Ontario, Canada.

I'm reaching out to you as I came across your profile on your school website. I'm currently examining sports surfaces used by NCAA colleges and US pro-leagues. Given your expertise in managing athletic fields, I am particularly interested in chatting with you.

In collaboration with a Fortune Global 100 chemical company, my team research project focuses on the North American sports turf market. I want to speak with the end users of athletic fields, such as yourself, to learn about what's valuable to you. More importantly, I want to identify the problems you wish could be resolved.

As a starting point, my team wants to understand the market segment needs to develop next generation playing surface technology. 

Would it be possible to get 40 minutes with you on the phone to ask you some questions about your sports surfaces, and what is important to you/the school/your student athletes?

If you are willing, please let me know your preferences on time, and I would be happy to accommodate your busy schedule.
        
Thank you ${PERSONNAME} - I look forward to hearing back from you!


Cheers,
